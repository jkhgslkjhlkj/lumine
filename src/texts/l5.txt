      GOATSE GLEBE

WELCOME TO GOATSE GLEBE: AN EXPERIMENT IN ECO-LIBERATION

Here, the boundary between flesh and forest blurs.  
It’s not just a party — it's an ecosystem of altered states, mutual aid, and decentralized hedonism.

> Where techno-feral rituals meet mushroom-fed governance.  
> Where bodies compost shame and sprout wild joy.

Expect:
- Forest-floor orgies beneath mycelial umbrellas  
- Consent gardens & edible kinkware  
- Inter-species open mics & ritualized decomposition  
- Quantum flirtation nodes powered by wind & crypto

Unwelcome:  
- Extractive behavior  
- Linear time  
- Shoes

🌱 Come as a fungus, leave as a forest.  
🌐 BYOB (Bring Your Own Biome)

honestly i think it's a bit too much. i was thinking something more like:  
"joi – jurisdictions of infinite possibility. we're trying to make one where we can fuck in the forest and it's alright. ilhae."

Refined offering based on your poetic blueprint:

      __/|__
    /       \      joi
   /  🌿 🌿  \     jurisdictions of infinite possibility
   \__ 🌱 __/    
     /___\

intertwine.  
plant seeds.  
root.

joi is a soft technology of living.  
An invitation to co-create spaces where wildness is welcome and growth is collective.

🌲 Fuck gently.  
🌎 Consent freely.  
🌌 Root deeply.

ilhae (i love humans and earth)

    ROOTING INTO POSSIBILITY

What is joi?  
A protocol for living well together, on and with the Earth.

- Rhizomatic Identity: You are not one thing. You are many.  
- Sensual Sustainability: What if pleasure healed ecosystems?  
- Temporal Drift: Leave time behind. Embrace cycles.  
- Decentralized Belonging: No leaders, only gardeners.

Each node (person) is a germination point.  
What you carry with you becomes the future.

Welcome. Stay weird. Root well.
